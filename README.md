# Goodbye

> It is a Turkish tradition to throw water behind a vehicle when the loved ones are setting out on a long journey.
> The tradition itself serves to express a wish â€”that the long journey will go smoothly, without mishap. As smooth as water.

### How it works

This program has to be running all the time to say goodbye to your unfollowers.

Start program with `./goodbye.py` and keep it running. You can host this on your server, Raspberry Pi or some always running computer.

Just terminate program with `Ctrl+C` to stop tracking.

### Advanced Configuration

In `goodbye.py` file, there are configuration keys:

    GOODBYE_MESSAGE = "@%s goodbye!"
    POLL_INTERVAL_SECS = 60*5

You can customize goodbye message with `GOODBYE_MESSAGE` string. You can adjust Twitter API polling interval as well, e.g. defaults to 5 minutes above.

## Demo

Try following me [`@ahmetalpbalkan`](http://twitter.com/ahmetalpbalkan) on Twitter and unfollow 10 minutes later (works only if I keep this program running).
